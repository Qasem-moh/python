# write a Python program that defines a list of numbers.
# store any numbers (positive and negative) in the list.
# the program should convert positive numbers into negative and negative numbers into positive. zeros remain unchanged.

# example:

# [1, -2, 0, 5, -10] becomes [-1, 2, 0, -5, 10].

def ConNumPoNe(number):
    return [-i for i in number]


numbers = [1, -2, 0, 5, -10]
print(ConNumPoNe(numbers))
